Smart Scoutis a web application that allows users or 'Scouts' to enter in Athlete Information and post that information to a database (MongoDB).  The application also has a page where users can search athletes in the database by ranking, position, or search their own players.  Each user must be assigned login credentials by an administrator.  This Web Application uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootsrap, Materialize and EJS (templating) for the UI.  NodeJS and Express Routing is used to handle POST and GET requests from the database (MongoDB).  User Authetication is done with the NPM package Passport, and the User credentials are encrypted with B-Crypt NodeJS.
